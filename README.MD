This workshop is for SMHacks 2017. Here, you will make a realtime web data visualization of movies that are trending at the moment (ie. Moana, Rogue One, Hidden Figures, etc.) using PubNub.
1. Clone the repo or download a zip file.
2. Open up "your_index.js" and "your_index.html". These are where you will write your code.
3. If you ever get lost, confused, or want to check correct code, you can check any of the "full_index" files for JS or HTML.
4. There are numbers, beginning in "your_index.html", that detail each piece of code you should add. CSS is done for you, but feel free to play with colors, fonts, and more (and movies.) 
5. Comments should help guide you, but here are the workshop slides, too: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y72J4ATvtLGQeVHqaB0S9GkRcE901N4k4NrEgXBwCj0/edit?usp=sharing
6. This workshop uses the PubNub Twitter Stream (which has its own channel and subscribe key, found at https://www.pubnub.com/developers/realtime-data-streams/twitter-stream/), but you also must generate your own API keys to publish the chart here, by signing in with Google: https://admin.pubnub.com/#/register?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=buffer&utm_content=buffer466e0&pi_visitorid=211579462&psc=WC-Tracking&pt=wc-tracking
